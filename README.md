# CodeVent2017
Code and files for my solutions to Advent of Code 2017

I thought it might be fun to share my solutions and see how other people solved the problems.

Advent of Code 2017 can be found here: http://adventofcode.com/2017

If you're on a PC with VS installed, you can compile and run the code by:
- Opening a Developer Command Prompt
- cd'ing into the folder with the .cs file in it
- executing the command: csc.exe codevent2017.cs
- executing codevent2017.exe

Note that the Main() function at the top of the file calls the appropriate puzzle solution function.
