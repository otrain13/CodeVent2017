# CodeVent2017
Code and files for my solutions to Advent of Code 2017

I thought it might be fun to share my solutions and see how other people solved the problems.

Advent of Code 2017 can be found here: http://adventofcode.com/2017

Code is all C# and can be compiled and run by loading the solution into Visual Studio.
